# Rock, Paper, Scissors, RUN

## Concept
*Rock, Paper, Scissors, RUN* is a game prototype which combines endless runner mechanics with "rock paper scissors." 

## Gameplay
The gameplay will involve conventional endless-runner mechanics - running, side-to-side movement, and jumping. The player will have to avoid or defeat the enemies they encounter. Both the enemies and the player will be rocks, papers, or scissors. The player character will rotate between rock, paper, and scissor based on a variant timer. The player must defeat compatible enemy types to earn points, while avoiding the other enemies. 

## Interface
The control scheme for movment will be the standard WASD keys and Spacebar. A simple HUD will show player score and time until player character rotation.  

## Art Style
The level and character art style will be low poly or primitive-based for rapid development.
